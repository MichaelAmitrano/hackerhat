# Hacker Hat
Script for optimizing Fedora for pen-testing.

Hacker Hat is designed to run on Fedora Linux and will optimize it for penetration testing purposes. Remember that this script will only run on Fedora Linux since it's RPM based. You could try running this on another RPM based Linux OS but it may not work.

Note: The script is designed to be run after a fresh installation of Fedora, if it is not a fresh installation, you can always comment out unneeded commands in the script before executing it.
